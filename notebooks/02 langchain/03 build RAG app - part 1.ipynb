    "### Overview\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing:** a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval and generation:** Takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "1. **Load:** First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\n",
    "2. **Split:** Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store:** We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Retrieval and Generation\n",

    "5. **Generate:** A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\n",
